S Geological Survey, Woods Hole Field Center's, Gulf of Mexico ArcView               GIS database. The Gulf of Mexico GIS database is intended to organize and display USGS held data and provide               on-line (WWW) access to the data and/or metadata.           Purpose:                This ArcView GIS layer is a 250m version of the composite Gulf of Mexico GLORIA sidescan sonar mosaic.           Supplemental_Information:                This version of the image has an "ice blue" background surrounding the mosaic area. This image is used with the               ArcView project views.      Time_Period_of_Content:           Time_Period_Information:                Multiple_Dates/Times:                     Calendar_Date: 19820202                     Calendar_Date: 19820224                     Calendar_Date: 19850807                     Calendar_Date: 19850903                     Calendar_Date: 19851002                     Calendar_Date: 19851022           Currentness_Reference: data collection      Status:           Progress: Complete           Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency: None planned      Spatial_Domain:           Bounding_Coordinates:                West_Bounding_Coordinate: -96                East_Bounding_Coordinate: -82                North_Bounding_Coordinate: 29.5                South_Bounding_Coordinate: 23      Keywords:           Theme:                Theme_Keyword_Thesaurus: General                Theme_Keyword: U.S. Geological Survey                Theme_Keyword: Woods Hole Field Center                Theme_Keyword: Gulf of Mexico database                Theme_Keyword: Exclusive Economic Zone                Theme_Keyword: EEZ                Theme_Keyword: GLORIA                Theme_Keyword: sidescan sonar                Theme_Keyword: sidescan sonar mosaic                Theme_Keyword: composite mosaic                Theme_Keyword: TIFF                Theme_Keyword: Geologic Long-Range Inclined Asdic                Theme_Keyword: Geotiff           Place:                Place_Keyword_Thesaurus: General                Place_Keyword: Gulf of Mexico                Place_Keyword: U.S. EEZ                Place_Keyword: U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone      Access_Constraints: None      Use_Constraints:           The U.S. Geological Survey must be referenced as the originator of the dataset in any future products or research derived from          these data.      Point_of_Contact:           Contact_Information:                Contact_Organization_Primary:                     Contact_Organization: U.
