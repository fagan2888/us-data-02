  Description:
    Abstract: This shapefile data layer represents the internal boundaries of the 48 contiguous United States and the political boundaries between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
    Purpose: This data layer includes the internal boundaries for the United States and the political boundaries of the US, Canada and Mexico.  The state boundaries are drawn to the U.S. coastline and does not include any coastline or islands.  The state boundaries does not extend beyond the shoreline and therefore does not represent state water territories.  This data layer was created so it could be used to indicate state boundaries when used with the high resolution NOS80K coastline (allus80k.shp) which does not include any internal boundaries.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset was created to be used with the NOS80K coastline (allus80k.shp) to provide state bounds.  In creating the data layer, some issues of the NOS80K coastline became apparent.  One example, is the US/Mexico boundary.  The NOS80K coastline closes and draws a straight line well below the Texas border.  The same type of problem can be seen around the US/Canada boundary of the Great Lakes.  The state_bounds.shp will draw the political boundaries while the allus80k.shp file will display the U.S. beyond the political boundaries.  If this is unacceptable to the user, they should consider masking the annexed U.S. possession.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The dataset is a derived from ESRI's 50 individual state 'trct' files.  The original state shapefiles were processed to dissolve the individual counties and create a comprehensive shapefile for each state.  Those individual state files where then combined to create the single US shapefile.  Several fields from the original dataset were removed.
