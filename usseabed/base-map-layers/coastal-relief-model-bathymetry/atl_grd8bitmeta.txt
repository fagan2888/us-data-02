  Description:
    Abstract: The National Geophysical Data Center assembled a gridded database referred to as the Coastal Relief Model (CRM).  NGDC created the comprehensive data set by merging the U.S. Geological Survey 3-arc-second DEMs with a compilation of hydrographic soundings covering the US East Coast.  The Coastal Relief Model extends from the coastal state boundaries to as far offshore as the data will support a continuous view of the seafloor.  This dataset formed the basis for the creating of the CRM bathymetry image for this product's GIS.
    Purpose: This image provides a color view of the CRM for the project area and is used as a basemap for overlaying usSEABED data.
