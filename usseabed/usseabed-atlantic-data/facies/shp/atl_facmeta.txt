  Description:
    Abstract:
      The facies data layer (_FAC.txt) is a point coverage of known sediment samplings, inspections, and probings from the usSEABED data collection and integrated using the software system dbSEABED.
      The facies data layer (_FAC.txt)represents concatenated information about components (minerals and rock type), genesis (igneous, metamorphic, carbonate, terrigenous), and other appropriate groupings of information about the seafloor.
      The facies data are parsed from written descriptions from cores, grabs, photographs, and videos, and may apply only to a subsample as denoted by the Top, Bottom, and SamplePhase fields.
      Lack of values in a defined facies field does not necessarily imply lack of the components defining that field, but may imply a lack of data for that field.
    Purpose:
      The Facies layer can be used to investigate the known information about a particular area of the seafloor.
      These data are intended for science researchers, policy makers, students, and the general public.  The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information.
    Supplemental_Information: This layer can be used in a relational data base, using the DataSetKey to link to the ATL_SRC.txt file for brief metadata information and to formal metadata written on each source, and to the other data files of usSEABED using the SiteKey or SampleKey as relational links.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accuracy of each attribute is dependent on the accuracy of the original source description and the values calculated by the mining software, dbSEABED.  Values are based on filters using fuzzy set theory and represent a measure of truth about the attribute.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Data in the usSEABED data collection are based on the observations and analyses of others, filtered through a unifying and mining software.  Each source report varies in type of information/data recorded and format.  Only those observations that are recorded can be filtered and mined; only presence (not absences) of information can be noted.
  Completeness_Report: Additional useable data may exist in this area; the authors appreciate any information and leads.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Locational accuracy is dependent on both the accuracy of the navigational technique and the level of detail about the location as recorded in the individual data sources, and may vary widely (ie.g., from 0.005 km (differential GPS) in the more recent surveys to greater than 2 km based on radar, Loran, or dead reckoning in the older surveys.
        Users of the data should note the metadata written about the original sources and use their own criteria for assessing the accuracy of the locations.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Depth determinations, both water depth and subsample depth, are dependent on the accuracy of the depth determination technique and the level of detail noted in the original source.
        Users of the data should note the metadata written about the original sources and use their own criteria for assessing the accuracy of the locations.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Source data may be digitized as necessary (typed or scanned in), with a visual inspection of digitized data to the source report and corrections as necessary, and are tested for completeness in Microsoft Excel as appropriate.  Other digital data may be decoded using source-specific programs, downloaded via the web, or sent directly to the USGS or University of Colorado via email.
        Data are formatted into the dbSEABED Data Entry template (db9_DataEntry.xls, version 08/07/2004) by hand, and tested using the dbSEABED relational database program (RDBi, version 01/05/2005) for correctness of formatting.
        Data are compiled into source data resource files (DRF) and processed through the dbSEABED data mining program (MNEt, version 04/07/2005) program, using the dbSEABED thesaurus (db9_dct.rtf, version 04/07/2005) and facies set up file for U.S. waters (db9_FAC.txt, version 04/07/2005).
        Data are iteratively reprocessed and corrected until noted errors are fixed, as recorded by the _RBDS.2fx and _MNE.DGN files.  Data are exercised in a GIS for location tests and useability.
